    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These are the cutest crepes, I simply <em>love</em> waking up to them in the morning.  
    </p>
    <p>
      No I don't feel the need to defend my ongoing relationship with a series of brunch crepes with you. Thanks for asking.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1-1/2 cups of milk</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling :</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1-1/2 cups finely chopped cooked ham</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced tomato</li>
      <li>cooking spary</li>
      <li>8 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Mix milk, flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Transfer batter to an electric blender and combine on high speed until blended; it's fine if batter has some lumps. Let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add ham and cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low and stir in spinach and tomato. Keep warm.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
			<li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking spray. Pour 1/3 cup batter into the skillet, swirling to cover the pan. Cook until underside of crepe is lightly brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Loosen edge of crepe and flip. Cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Set aside; repeat with remaining batter.</li>
			<li>Place crepes onto the prepared baking sheet. Add ham-veggie mixture to the center of each crepe. Crack an egg carefully over ham mixtures. Fold edges of crepes inward.</li>
      <li>Bake crepes in the preheated oven until egg whites set, 8 to 11 minutes. Top crepes with parsley and season with salt and pepper.</li>
