      No I don't feel the need to defend my ongoing relationship with a series
      of brunch crepes with <strong>you</strong>. Thanks for asking.

      <li>1-1/2 cups finely chopped cooked ham</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh spinach</li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced tomato</li>

      <li>8 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
      <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix milk, flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and salt together in a bowl.
        Transfer batter to an electric blender and combine on high speed until
        blended; it's fine if batter has some lumps. Let rest for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Add ham and
        cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes. Add onion and cook until
        softened, about 5 minutes more. Reduce heat to low and stir in spinach
        and tomato. Keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and lightly coat with cooking
        spray. Pour 1/3 cup batter into the skillet, swirling to cover the pan.
        Cook until underside of crepe is lightly brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Loosen
        edge of crepe and flip. Cook until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes more.
        Set aside; repeat with remaining batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place crepes onto the prepared baking sheet. Add ham-veggie mixture to
        the center of each crepe. Crack an egg carefully over ham mixtures. Fold
        edges of crepes inward.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake crepes in the preheated oven until egg whites set, 8 to 11 minutes.
        Top crepes with parsley and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
