    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken breast in a saucepan with enough water to cover. Bring to
        a boil, and cook until no longer pink, about 20 minutes. Drain and cool
        slightly, then cut into strips.

      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a small skillet over medium heat, melt butter with garlic,
        onion, and basil. Pour into a chilled dish to cool, and refrigerate
        until set.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Roll out pizza dough, place onto a pizza pan or other baking sheet, and
        spread herb butter over surface using the back of a spoon. Arrange
        chicken on top, then dot with ricotta cheese. Top with tomato slices,
        cilantro, and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until crust is browned
        and the center is cooked through.
